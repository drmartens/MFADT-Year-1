## International Business Calculator
1. Calculator app that speaks in 38 languages and speaks corrct currency types and formats for each language.
2. Works in Day Mode or Night Mode.
3. Sound can be muted in app for convenience.
4. Bonus Feature is a Tip calculator that gives a 20% tip on the total displayed.
5. Another cool feature is that numbers are formatted more naturally for speaking with currency strings. E.g. $3.00 + $3.00 but $3.00 x 3. Although this may not carry into other languages due to verb, thought it was a cool function and couldn't fix it short of adding in a more sophisticated translate function, so decided to keep it.
